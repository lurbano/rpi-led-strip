    <h1>Points: Basic Programming Concepts</h1>
    Here we'll write programs to work with two points, starting by finding the slope of the line between the two points.

              <figcaption>Fig 1. Two points. Point 1: (2,4) and Point2: (6,7).</figcaption>
            </figure>

            The slope (m) of a line between two points is a measure of how fast the line goes up, so you take the vertical change (the change in y (Δy)), divided by the horizantal change (the change in x (Δx).

            $$ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $$

            <figure>
              <img src="pts_slope.png" style="width:400px;">
              <figcaption>Fig 2. Finding the slope. </figcaption>
            </figure>

            For this specific problem we can easily calculate the change in y and change in x, however, for a program we'll want to generalize as much as possible, so we'll label the two points as Point 1 and Point 2 and the coordinates as (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>):

            <figure>
              <img src="pts_slope-x1y1.png" style="width:400px;">
              <figcaption>Fig 3. Finding the change in y and the change in x. </figcaption>
            </figure>

            So, ultimately, we'll go with the three equations:
            $$ \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 $$
            $$ \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 $$
            $$ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $$

              <b>Comments</b>: Anything after a "#" is  commented out, which means it is ignored when the program is run. This is a good way to make notes to explain what the program is doing.

              <b>Declaring Variables</b>: On <code>Line 2</code> we create a variable named <code>x1</code> and give it a value of 2. Variable names have to start with a letter, but can be upper or lower case.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Using Variables</b>: On <code>Line 10</code> we calculate the horizontal distance between the two points (Δx). I name the variable <code>Dx</code> instead of <code>Δx</code> simply because the upper case "D" is easier to type on my keyboard: <code>Δx</code> would work as a variable name in python.

          Tuples are a simple way of grouping variables. Since each point has both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates it makes sense to group them together. So, we can rewrite the program like so:

            <p>
              <b>Initialization function</b>: <code>Line 2</code>'s "<code>__init__</code>" is the class' initialization function. Your class will almost always need one of these. This one takes three variables, and the first one <code>self</code> is required for the class to be able to save things for later; the other two variables are just the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the point.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Saving Properties</b>: <code>Lines 3 and 4</code> save the x and y values internally so we can use them later. These internal variables are specific to each time we use the class, and are called <i>properties</i>.

            <p>
              <b>Creating Instances of the class</b>: On <code>Lines 7 and 10</code> we create our points (<code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>) as <i>instances</i> of the <code>point</code> class. Notice that we give each point its <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Using the Instances of the class</b>: On <code>Line 13</code> we get the horizontal difference by subtracting point 2's <i>x</i> value (<code>p2.x</code>) from point 1's (<code>p1.x</code>).

                def slope(x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2):
              </code></pre>
              Functions are created with the <code>def</code> keyword. In this case, the function is named <code>slope</code> and takes four values as inputs, which are given variable names: <code>x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2</code>. The function is the first thing in the code because when the program is run, it is saved so we can use it later. If a function is called before it is defined you'll get an error.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Local variables</b>: The variable names from the function definition only exist within the function, this way multiple functions, or even the main program, can use the same variable names without conflicting with one another. Therefore, we could have used <code>x1, y1, x2, y2</code> even though these names are used in the main code.

              On <code>Line 9</code> we use the <code>return</code> keyword to return the result of the function to the place where it was called.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Calling the function</b>
              <pre ><code class="language-python" no-whitespace-normalization>
              m = slope(x1, y1, x2, y2)
              </code></pre>
              We call the function by using its name (<code>slope</code>) and <i>passing</i> it the four values the function expects. We could have just put in the numbers directly, and left out <code>Lines 14-20</code> like so:
              <pre ><code class="language-python" no-whitespace-normalization>
              m = slope(2, 4, 6, 7)
