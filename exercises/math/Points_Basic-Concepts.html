    <h1>Points: Basic Programming Concepts</h1>
    Here we'll write programs to work with two points, starting by finding the slope of the line between the two points.

              <figcaption>Fig 1. Two points. Point 1: (2,4) and Point2: (6,7).</figcaption>
            </figure>

            The slope (m) of a line between two points is a measure of how fast the line goes up, so you take the vertical change (the change in y (Δy)), divided by the horizantal change (the change in x (Δx).

            $$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $$

            <figure>
              <img src="pts_slope.png" style="width:400px;">
              <figcaption>Fig 2. Finding the slope. </figcaption>
            </figure>

            For this specific problem we can easily calculate the change in y and change in x, however, for a program we'll want to generalize as much as possible, so we'll label the two points as Point 1 and Point 2 and the coordinates as (x<sub>1</sub>, y<sub>1</sub>) and (x<sub>2</sub>, y<sub>2</sub>):

            <figure>
              <img src="pts_slope-x1y1.png" style="width:400px;">
              <figcaption>Fig 3. Finding the change in y and the change in x. </figcaption>
            </figure>

            So, ultimately, we'll go with the three equations:
            $$ \Delta x = x_2 - x_1 $$
            $$ \Delta y = y_2 - y_1 $$
            $$ m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} $$

              <b>Comments</b>: Anything after a "#" is  commented out, which means it is ignored when the program is run. This is a good way to make notes to explain what the program is doing.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Declaring Variables</b>: On <code>Line 2</code> we create a variable named <code>x1</code> and give it a value of 2. Variable names have to start with a letter, but can be upper or lower case.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Using Variables</b>: On <code>Line 10</code> we calculate the horizontal distance between the two points (Δx). I name the variable <code>Dx</code> instead of <code>Δx</code> simply because the upper case "D" is easier to type on my keyboard: <code>Δx</code> would work as a variable name in python.

        <h3>Program: Tuples </h3>
        <p>
          Tuples are a simple way of grouping variables. Since each point has both <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> coordinates it makes sense to group them together. So, we can rewrite the program like so:

              <b>Tuple</b>: <code>Line 2</code> makes a tuple of <code>(2, 4)</code> and assigns it to another tuple <code>(x1, y1)</code>. Since there's a pair of values in each tuple, the values are assigned to their respective variables.

            <p>
              <b>Initialization function</b>: <code>Line 2</code>'s "<code>__init__</code>" is the class' initialization function. Your class will almost always need one of these. This one takes three variables, and the first one <code>self</code> is required for the class to be able to save things for later; the other two variables are just the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the point.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Saving Properties</b>: <code>Lines 3 and 4</code> save the x and y values internally so we can use them later. These internal variables are specific to each time we use the class, and are called <i>properties</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Creating Instances of the class</b>: On <code>Lines 7 and 10</code> we create our points (<code>p1</code> and <code>p2</code>) as <i>instances</i> of the <code>point</code> class. Notice that we give each point its <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> values.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Using the Instances of the class</b>: On <code>Line 13</code> we get the horizontal difference by subtracting point 2's <i>x</i> value (<code>p2.x</code>) from point 1's (<code>p1.x</code>).

              Getting the square root is the same as raising the number to the 0.5 power:  <code>25**0.5</code> equals <code>5.0</code>.
